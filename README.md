# OpenLP Doc

Transform OpenLP song and service data into a song sheet

At the moment, no package is published (since this is just a quick tool for me).
So it assumes you have poetry installed.
Run with `poetry run openlp_doc <service file>`.
For example:
`poetry run openlp_doc tests/resources/Service\ 2024-01-20\ 23-43.osz`
